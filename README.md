# Wynntils Upgraded Music

Hi, welcome to our music library for wynntils. You can install these to your folder and play these tracks instead of the orginal wynncraft ones. These will replace the wynncraft ones, although theres a few differences in music style and composition. Heres a few things you should keep in mind:

* Make sure to install from the `main` branh instead of the `dev` brach. Whilst we try our best to make sure everything here is ok to use, everyone makes mistakes and sometimes audio may have incorrect volume, wrong ending points, or even be copywrited. 

* continued later
